# Finishing a Development Branch

## Overview

Guide completion of development work by presenting clear options and handling chosen workflow.

**Core principle:** Verify tests → Present options → Execute choice → Clean up.

**Announce at start:** "I'm using the finishing-a-development-branch skill to complete this work."

## The Process

### Step 1: Verify Tests

**Before presenting options, verify tests pass:**

```bash
npm test / cargo test / pytest / go test ./...
```

If tests fail: stop. Don't proceed to Step 2.

### Step 2: Determine Base Branch

```bash
git merge-base HEAD main 2>/dev/null || git merge-base HEAD master 2>/dev/null
```

### Step 3: Present Options

Present exactly these 4 options:

```
Implementation complete. What would you like to do?

1. Merge back to <base-branch> locally
2. Push and create a Pull Request
3. Keep the branch as-is (I'll handle it later)
4. Discard this work

Which option?
```

### Step 4: Execute Choice

#### Option 1: Merge Locally
```bash
git checkout <base-branch> && git pull && git merge <feature-branch>
# Verify tests, then: git branch -d <feature-branch>
```

#### Option 2: Push and Create PR
```bash
git push -u origin <feature-branch>
gh pr create --title "<title>" --body "..."
```

#### Option 3: Keep As-Is
Report location. Don't cleanup worktree.

#### Option 4: Discard
Require typed "discard" confirmation before deleting.

### Step 5: Cleanup Worktree

For Options 1, 2, 4 only:
```bash
git worktree remove <worktree-path>
```

## Quick Reference

| Option | Merge | Push | Keep Worktree | Cleanup Branch |
|--------|-------|------|---------------|----------------|
| 1. Merge locally | ✓ | - | - | ✓ |
| 2. Create PR | - | ✓ | ✓ | - |
| 3. Keep as-is | - | - | ✓ | - |
| 4. Discard | - | - | - | ✓ (force) |

## Red Flags

**Never:**
- Proceed with failing tests
- Merge without verifying tests on result
- Delete work without confirmation
- Force-push without explicit request

## Integration

**Called by:**
- **subagent-driven-development** - After all tasks complete
- **executing-plans** - After all batches complete

**Pairs with:**
- **using-git-worktrees** - Cleans up worktree created by that skill
